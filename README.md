Mask Detection Project
This repository contains the code for a mask detection model achieving an accuracy of 97% with a 0.08 error rate.

Technologies Used:

Machine Learning Framework: (Specify the framework you used, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Deep Learning Model: (Specify the model architecture you used, e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN))
Dataset: (Specify the dataset you used for training and validation, e.g., custom dataset, public dataset like VOC https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/pascal-voc, etc.)
Programming Language: (Specify the programming language used, e.g., Python)
Project Structure:

README.md: This file (you're currently editing it).
model.py: (or relevant filename) Contains the definition and training script for the mask detection model.
data_preprocessing.py: (or relevant filename) Contains code for loading, preprocessing, and augmenting the dataset.
utils.py: (or relevant filename) Contains utility functions used throughout the project (optional).
requirements.txt: Lists the Python libraries required to run the project.
maskdetection.h5: The trained model file (stored using Git LFS if applicable).
(Optional) data/: Folder containing the training and validation datasets (if not stored elsewhere).
How to Run:

Install Dependencies:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
(Optional) Download Dataset:

If you're using a public dataset, download it and place it in the data folder according to the instructions for that dataset.
If you're using a custom dataset, ensure it's already placed in the data folder with the appropriate structure.
Train the Model:

Bash
python model.py --train (optional arguments)
Use code with caution.
Replace (optional arguments) with any specific training parameters you want to use (e.g., specifying epochs, batch size, etc.). Refer to the model.py script for available options.

(Optional) Evaluate the Model:

Bash
python model.py --evaluate (optional arguments)
Use code with caution.
This script (if included) will load the trained model and evaluate its performance on the validation dataset.

Additional Notes:

This is a basic structure, and you might need to adjust it based on your specific implementation.
Consider including instructions on how to use the trained model for inference (making predictions on new images).
Feel free to add more details about the model architecture, training process, and evaluation results.
Disclaimer:

The accuracy and error rate mentioned are based on the specific dataset and training configuration used. These values may vary depending on the data and training parameters.
